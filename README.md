## Functional domains in mouse striatum

In their seminal study, Hintiryan et al. (2016) investigated the functional diversity of the mouse dorsal striatum. 
They developed a detailed connectivity projection map from the cerebral cortex to the dorsal striatum (CP), 
identifying 29 distinct functional striatal domains in three striatal divisions: rostral, intermediate and caudal (Figure 1).
